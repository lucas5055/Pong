<h1>Greetings!</h1>
Hello and welcome to my first executable app, i'm so happy to have you here and before we get started i just want to sey thank you for spending your time in this begginer project, but i can asure you it will be woth.
<h1>O que Ã© o Pong?</h1>
Pong is a TÃªnis themed game, one of the first even designed and released by Atari in 1972 in the good olds Arcade game machine and you may ask now... <br> <h2><i>Why did you decided to recreate this specific game?</i></h2>
<h4>And i awnser you:</h4> <br>
To be honest i don't have a reason for this, and yeah i know, this might sound disappointing but i don't think you should sell some kind of entertainment <br> this is just a game, a simple game and i'm not here to say that you should'nt sell you project <br> i know is hard to build something but this game is so simple that i though "Why not?" <br> for a first project i can show what i am cappcable without taking people's money, but anyway let's talk about the game.
I created this game only with Python and Pygame, because it's the only language i know beside HTML and CSS, <b>(Until the moment i'm posting this)</b> <br>
i know it would be easy if i knew other languages but i one thing at time ok?
<h1>About</h1>
This game is very simple you start and you have a racket and your oponent have another. <br>
the way it's designed now it's for two players in the same keyboard using W and S (Player 1) and UP and DOWN (Player 2).<br>
I have some plans to implement AI to the game but this is for future, i can't do this rigth now (because i don't even know how)<br>
<h1>Future plans</h1>
I have some ideas to implement it might get some time because of work and college but we are getting there, and if you want to help me i would be glad to have any help ðŸ˜‰<br>
